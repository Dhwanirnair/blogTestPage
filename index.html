                    In an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, Remith Raghavan stands at the intersection of innovation, resilience, and strategy. As a seasoned Cyber Security Analyst with over four years of experience, Remith's expertise spans vulnerability management, cloud security architecture, email and endpoint protection, and patch deployment at scale. At Western Financial Group, he has spearheaded transformative initiatives-from building a custom CVSS 4.0-based Vulnerability Risk Assessment tool to executing enterprise-wide cloud security protocols using Azure, Intune, and Proofpoint technologies. His contributions have dramatically decreased organizational vulnerabilities from 90% to 25% in under five months. Most recently, Remith has taken the helm of a critical Windows 10 to 11 migration project, leading the CIS Benchmark deployment across 2,600+ devices via Intune. His focus on security hardening, compliance, and optimized configuration is steering the organization toward a more secure and agile infrastructure. Additionally, he is driving the transition of Azure Update Manager from proof-of-concept to full production, reinforcing the company's patching efficiency and system reliability. Outside of the SOC, Remith shares his knowledge as a Cyber Security Instructor, mentoring future defenders and translating complex concepts into actionable learning. With certifications ranging from CompTIA CYSA+ and Cloud+ to SC-100, CEH v11, and in-progress CISSP and CCSP credentials, his commitment to continuous growth is evident in both his teaching and technical leadership.

                                    I am a Cybersecurity and Cloud Security Professional with over four years of hands-on experience securing enterprise IT environments and supporting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) across critical infrastructure, financial services, and cloud-first organizations.<br><br>Cyber Security Analyst — SaskEnergy, Canada (2025 – Present)<br><br>In my current role, I work at the intersection of enterprise IT security and operational technology (OT). I collaborate closely with SCADA and automation teams to monitor, analyze, and respond to cyber threats impacting both corporate and ICS environments. My responsibilities include incident response, threat analysis, vulnerability management, and patch governance aligned with ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks. I also contribute to cloud security initiatives across Azure, AWS, and Microsoft 365, while automating detection and remediation workflows using PowerShell, Python, and KQL to improve efficiency and resilience.<br><br>Cyber Security Analyst — Western Financial Group, Canada (2022 – 2025)<br><br>Previously, I supported a large financial enterprise with a strong focus on vulnerability management, patch automation, and email security. I led vulnerability scanning initiatives using Tenable.io and designed a custom Vulnerability Risk Assessment framework based on CVSS 4.0, significantly improving remediation SLAs. I played a key role in enterprise patch management using Automox, Intune Autopatch, SCCM, and Azure Update Manager, reducing organizational risk exposure. I also handled advanced phishing and email-based threats using Proofpoint TAP, Cloud TRAP, and PhishER, while strengthening cloud security posture through CASB solutions and Microsoft Intune.<br><br>Cyber Security Instructor — ABM College & AEC College, Canada (2023 – 2025)<br><br>Alongside my industry work, I have served as a Cyber Security Instructor, delivering structured, practical training to students pursuing careers in cybersecurity. I developed lesson plans, labs, and study schedules covering network security, cloud security, vulnerability management, and incident response, while mentoring students to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.<br><br>Early Cybersecurity & Technical Experience<br><br>My cybersecurity career began with an analyst internship and peer tutoring, which helped solidify my foundation in security operations, tooling, and professional communication. Prior to transitioning into cybersecurity, I built over a decade of experience in engineering, operations management, and technical sales across Canada, Singapore, and India. These roles strengthened my understanding of risk, compliance, systems thinking, and stakeholder communication, which I now apply directly to cybersecurity leadership and decision-making.
